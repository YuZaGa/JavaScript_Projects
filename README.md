## JavaScript Projects

This is a basic description of all the projects that I did involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript.


- [SMIT Result](https://github.com/YuZaGa/SMITResult)

  >   A combination of multiple projects for all result related needs of SMIT. It started with me trying to emulate functionality of the similar app made by a senior but turned into it's own thing when I got a grasp of pyhton automation which resulted in it being capable of finding CGPA rank. 
  It makes extensive usage of multipage functionalities, DOM Manipulation, JS based calculations on JSON files obtained through web scraping using BeautifulSoup.
